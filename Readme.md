Doppler trajectory fitting tools. Currently this is designed to use the airpsy SDR with modified host code to add timestamping. For acceptable performance it is necessary to use a GPSDO, but in the future it might be possible to get away with NTPD only. 
Ground tracking is designed to run independently at remote ground station sites. Pseudorange files can then be sent to a central location via your favourite file transfer method for the trajectory to be produced (the inversion step). Currently the inveresion is in need of a better atmospheric model, but has been tested successfully with only 2 simulated station, giving >95% reliability. With three stations very reliable performance is obtained, which high accuracy in the range of meters maximum error if the pseudrange data is trimmed to the point around apogee ~+-50s.
